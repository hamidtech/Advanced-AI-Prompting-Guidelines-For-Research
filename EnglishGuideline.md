## General Tips for Effective Prompting
- **Be Specific**: Clearly define your role, task, and format.  
- **Context Matters**: Provide enough background for the AI to be accurate.  
- **Adjust Creativity**: Specify how creative or conservative you want the AI to be (low, moderate, high).  
- **Review & Refine**: After the AI responds, refine your prompt for more precise results.

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Overly Vague Prompts**: Without specifics, AI might generate generic content.  
2. **Too Many Requests at Once**: Break down complex tasks into smaller steps.  
3. **Lack of Context**: The AI needs background info to give accurate answers.  
4. **Neglecting Creativity Settings**: Forgetting to specify creativity might yield uninteresting results.  

---

## Sample Workflow
1. **Draft**: Sketch a basic prompt with Role, Task, and Format.  
2. **Refine**: Add details about creativity level, audience, and possible constraints.  
3. **Generate**: Ask the AI for output.  
4. **Review**: Check for clarity, relevance, and novelty.  
5. **Iterate**: Repeat until satisfied with the AI‚Äôs suggestions.
