# AI Prompt Maestro: Advanced Research Guidance

**Your go-to repository for crafting effective AI prompts in academic and research contexts.** 🌱

## Overview
Welcome to the **AI Prompt Maestro** repo! This project provides a curated set of guidelines and templates for researchers who want to leverage AI assistance at different stages of academic work—be it generating thesis ideas, exploring article angles, creating book outlines, crafting cross-disciplinary research titles, or discovering research gaps. 

We’ve included these main guideline files:
- [**EnglishGuideline.md**](EnglishGuideline.md) (به زبان انگلیسی)
- [**PersianGuideline.md**](PersianGuideline.md) (به زبان فارسی)

And now we have **a new file** for summarizing **Farsi/English academic references** in a single paragraph:
- [**ThesisSummaryPrompt.md**](ThesisSummaryPrompt.md)

Within these guidelines, you’ll find detailed prompt structures, sample templates, and example-filled prompts—plus helpful tips on how to make your AI queries more effective. 🤩
